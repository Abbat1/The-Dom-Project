This is a webpage about two fashion brqnds that not only do i wear, but i love. Including with a car that is one of my all time favorites if i must say with audio of a 0-200 of the cars acceleration. 
For the audio source, i copied a youtube link of the audio i wanted to play, then converted it to a mp3 so it would be recognized by my computer. After that, i input the link in an audio element in the audio tag and source it  by folder thats saved to my computer.
as for the photos, the corvette image is a gif, and the other two pictures are regular photos that have been resized.
